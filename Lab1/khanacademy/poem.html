        <h1>Thanksgiving Day</h1>
        <p>
            Only the wrinkle
            of a disappearing squirrel
            breaks the snow stillness.
        
        <br>
            The walker, swathed in wool,
            lowers toward the prints left
            by others, feet that lead to the village.
        <br>
        
            There a clock stands in front of a closed shop,
            its hour not late, though the moon has come early
            to mirror the white coin of its frozen face.
